## Introduction

I'm a information tecnology student specializing in embedded systems and electronics. At the moment I mainly use GitHub for storing and managing important files, but this might change in the future. I will add updates on my projects here and on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leevi-kinnunen-a4529a22b/) profile.

<br />
## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on analog drones as a hobby. My hobby is developing and maintaining my expertise in electrical enegineering, wireless data transfer and utilization of various software. The 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz frequencies are a big part of what I do and it's important to understand them. Building drones teaches the function of different components and I want to constantly develop my skills in this field.
<br />
<br />
Drones and the accessories that are used with them require constant upkeep. The more you fly, the more you fix and configure things. For example the 5 Inch drone is rebuilt over 6 times for different reasons. Softwares also get constant updates which add more features.
